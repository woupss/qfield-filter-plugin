qfield-filter-plugin make filter in QField a reality.

With it you can select a layer and a field of your project and i will propose a list of values of attributes from your project selected layer or write 1 or many values to filter on this define layer field.

You can filter number or text and it is not case sensitive

It will highlight filtered geometries and hide others or show all via a checkbox.

If you longpress the plugin icon it will delete the filter.

It is a starting project so, i hope, it will be even better in future
